Uses of sulfur include:<br>
<ul>
<li><span class="yh">Alleviates various medical conditions</span> such as scabies, ringworm, eczema, and acne. Drugs (in the form of ointments, soaps, lotions, and creams) with sulfur in them are called <span class="yh">sulfonamides</span>; they are plentiful. In large doses, they sometimes cause strong allergic reactions including <em>Stevens-Johnson syndrome</em> and <em>toxic epidermal necrolysis</em>.</li>
<li>Sulfuric acid is produced to <span class="yh">manufacture fertilizers, adhesives, animal feed, cement, explosives, glass, fumigants, matches, and inorganic chemicals</span>. Itâ€™s also used in manufacturing rubber and steel.</li>

<li>Regarded as an <span class="yh">essential mineral in the human body</span>; it makes up 0.25% of human body weight. It's not produced by the body, so it's important to intake sulfur from various food sources. It's essential mainly because of its role in preventing serious disorders. Also, it's found in the essential amino acids <em>cysteine</em> and <em>methionine</em>.</li>
<li>Sulfur dioxide is used to <span class="yh">bleach, disinfect, and refrigerate.</span></li>
<li>Magnesium sulfates (or epsom salts) are used as <span class="yh">laxatives and nutritional supplements</span> in plants.</li>
<li><span class="yh">One of the oldest fungicides and pesticides</span>. Its natural properties clearly make sulfur one of the most essential ingredients in pesticides - even Homer (an old Greek poet/writer) recommends the use of <em>pest-averting sulfur</em> to all Greek citizens. </li>
</ul>
