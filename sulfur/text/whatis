Sulfur may be found as a pure mineral ("native" sulfur) and historically was usually obtained in this way. However, today's sulfur production is as a side product of other industrial processes, such as oil refining. In these processes, sulfur often occurs as sulfur compounds, which are then converted to elemental sulfur.
As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a biological product, like oil. It was removed from such mines mainly by the Frasch process.[12] In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the relatively pure (99.5%) melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur which required no further purification. Howevever, due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working the
