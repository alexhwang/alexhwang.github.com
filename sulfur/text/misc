Sulfur was originally spelled <em>sulphur</em> in the UK and Asia, but <em>sulfur</em> was used instead because of its widespread usage in the United States.<br><br>	Burning coal and/or petroleum (as many power plants do) generates sulfur dioxide - this combines with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid. These acids help to create acid rain, which sometimes results in enormous damage to the environment and man-made structures.<br><br>	The phrase “smell of sulfur” refers to the pungent odor of hydrogen sulfide. Some people also say it smells like “rotten eggs“, this can easily be noticed at a hot spring or in a volcanic area. Sulfur dioxide also has a sort of “suffocating” odor that is smelt in burnt matches.
