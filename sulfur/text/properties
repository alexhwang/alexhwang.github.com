 Sulfur is in <span class="yh">group 16</span>; <span class="yh">the oxygen family</span>, or chalcogens. Its symbol is <span class="yh">S</span>.<br> Other elements in the family include oxygen, selenium, and tellurium.<br> The family members are all very reactive. They also show similar patterns in their electron configuration; they all have 6 valence electrons and 2 electrons in the first shell. The first two members of this family, oxygen and sulfur are both nonmetals. The rest of the members, selenium, tellurium, and polonium, are metalloid semiconductors. These members are also commonly found as minerals, for example as pyrite or calaverite.<br> The atomic mass is 32.065 amu.<br> Sulfur exists in two allotropic forms - alpha-form and beta-form. Alpha-form has a density of 2.07 grams per cm3, and beta-form has a density of 1.96 grams per cm3.<br> Sulfur is a solid at room temperature.<br> Its boiling point is 444.6 Celsius. Its melting point is 115.21 Celsius. <br>Sulfur (at room temperature) is a soft, bright-yellow solid. It has a faint odor. Sulfur insulates electricity. It easily sublimes and is soluble in other liquids.<br> Sulfur combines with most other elements. It can do so at room temperature and when it’s heated.<br> Sulfur combines with magnesium when it’s heated to form magnesium sulfide. Other compounds include hydrogen sulfide, lead sulfide (pyrite), and iron sulfide.
