<li><span class="yh">Sulfur is in group 16</span>, <span class="yh">the oxygen family</span>, or chalcogens. Its symbol is <span class="yh">S</span></li>
<li>Other elements in the family include oxygen, selenium, and tellurium. The family members are all <span class="yh">very reactive</span>. They also show similar <span class="yh">patterns in their electron configuration</span>; they all have <span class="yh">6 valence electrons</span> and 2 electrons in the first shell. The first two members of this family, oxygen and sulfur are <span class="yh">both nonmetals</span>. The rest of the members, selenium, tellurium, and polonium, are <span class="yh">metalloid semiconductors</span>. These members are also <span class="yh">commonly found as minerals</span>, for example as pyrite or calaverite.</li>

<li>Its atomic mass is <span class="yh">32.065 amu</span></li>
<li>Sulfur exists in <span class="yh">two allotropic forms - alpha-form and beta-form</span>. Alpha-form has a density of 2.07 grams per cm3, and beta-form has a density of 1.96 grams per cm3.</li>
<li>Sulfur is a <span class="yh")>solid</span> at room temperature. <span class="yh">Its boiling point is 444.6 Celsius.</span> <span class="yh">Its melting point is 115.21 Celsius.</span></li>
<li>Sulfur (at room temperature):<br>

<li>is a <span class="yh">soft, bright-yellow solid</span></li>
<li>has a <span class="yh">faint odor</span></li>
<li><span class="yh">insulates electricity</span></li>
<li>easily <span class="yh">sublimes</span></li>
<li>when burned, <span class="yh">melts to a blood-red liquid</span> and emits a blue flame in the dark</li>
<li>is <span class="yh">soluble</span> in other liquids</li>
<li><span class="yh">combines with most other elements</span>, it can do so at room temperature and when it’s heated. Sulfur combines with magnesium <span class="yh">when it’s heated</span> to form magnesium sulfide. Other compounds include hydrogen sulfide, lead sulfide (pyrite), and iron sulfide.</li>
