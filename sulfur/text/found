Sulfur is found commonly in <span class="yh">extremly large and hot stars</span> as its isotope sulfur-32. Sulfur is also commonly found on <span class="yh">meteorites and moons</span>, such as Earth's moon. It's the 10th most common element in the universe.<br><br>
On Earth, sulfur is mainly found near <span class="yh">hot springs and volcanic regions</span>, especially along The Ring of Fire near the Pacific Ocean. Examples of these places include Indonesia, Chile, Japan, and Itally.
<br><br>
Another place sulfur is found is in <span class="yh">salt domes</span> along the Gulf of Mexico, and in <span class="yh">evaporated sediments</span> in eastern Europe and western Asia.
<br><br>
Of course, sulfur probably doesn't <em>just</em> appear in nature as its pure elemental form, we know from <a href="#" onclick="unfoldInfo('properties')" style="color:red;opacity:0.8;">Properties</a> that <span class="yh">sulfur forms many compounds</span>. Sulfur compounds found in nature include pyrite (iron sulfide), cinnabar (mercury sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), sphalerite (zinc sulfide), and stibnite (antimony sulfide) in the places mentioned above.
