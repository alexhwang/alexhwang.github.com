Sulfur was known in ancient times - it was referred to in the Bible and Torah as “brimstone”. The Bible refers to the place of eternal damnation, or hell, as smelling of sulfur - probably because it’s associated with volcanic activity. Sulfur has been used for centuries in Ancient Chinese medicine - chemists extracted sulfur from pyrite in the 3rd century AD. Sulfur was also used in Ancient Greece for fumigation; the process of pest control by filling an area with gaseous pesticides.<br><br>Sulfur was known as shiliuhuang in Ancient China since the 6th century BC in its plentiful, natural form. During the Song Dynasty, it was also used as an ingredient in black powder - an invention that soon spread to Europe and changed warfare around the world. Alchemists gave sulfur a special symbol that looked like a triangle at the top of a cross.
