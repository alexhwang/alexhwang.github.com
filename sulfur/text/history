Sulfur was <span class="yh">known in ancient times</span> - it was referred to in the Bible and Torah as <span class="yh">“brimstone”</span>. The Bible refers to the place of eternal damnation, or hell, as smelling of sulfur - probably because it’s <span class="yh">associated with volcanic activity</span>. Sulfur has been used for centuries in <span class="yh">Ancient Chinese medicine</span> - chemists <span class="yh">extracted sulfur from pyrite</span> in the 3rd century AD. Sulfur was also used in Ancient Greece for <span class="yh">fumigation</span>; the process of pest control by filling an area with gaseous pesticides.<br><br>Sulfur was known as <em>shiliuhuang</em> in Ancient China since the 6th century BC in its plentiful, natural form. During the Song Dynasty, it was also used as an ingredient in <span class="yh">black powder</span> - an invention that soon spread to Europe and changed warfare around the world. Alchemists gave sulfur a special symbol that looked like a triangle at the top of a cross.<br><br>
It wasn't until A.D. 1777 that French scientist Antoine Lavoisier convinced the European scientific community that sulfur was an element, not a compound.
