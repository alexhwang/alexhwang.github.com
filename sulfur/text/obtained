Sulfur is mainly <span class="yh">obtained through mining</span>. Up until the 20th century the <span class="yh">Frasch process</span> was used to extract sulfur, where superheated steam is pumped down into a deposit of underground sulfur. Since the melting point of sulfur is relatively low (115 Celsius), the sulfur will liquify. After this, the liquid sulfur is drawn out.

Today, sulfur is produced by drawing it out from <span class="yh">petroleum, natural gas, and other fossil structures</span>. The common product in these chemical reactions is hydrogen sulfide (a gas) that can easily be converted to other compounds of sulfur.
